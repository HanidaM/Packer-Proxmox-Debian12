# Packer-Proxmox-Debian12
Packer builder is able to create new images for use with Proxmox. The builder takes an ISO image, runs any provisioning necessary on the image after launching it, then creates a virtual machine template. This template can then be used as to create new virtual machines within Proxmox.
